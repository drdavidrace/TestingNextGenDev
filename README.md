# TestingNextGenDev
This respository contains some of the codes used to test my Next Generation Development Environment.  Most of them are simple, but are designed to make sure the Linux/ChromeOS integration meets the needs for a cost effective, yet powerful development environment.  Fundamentally, this environment needs to integrate with GitHub and the Google ecosystem while providing the ability to do unit testing.  A bonus will be supporting simple Jupyter Lab notebooks that can be ported to the Google Colaboratory environment.

## Jupyter Notebooks

* graph_test.ipynb - This is a simple graph to verify that the Jupyter installation is working.
